# Fracture Studio

**Argument Audit Engine** — surgical AI-powered analysis of argumentative essays with national-circuit debate judge intelligence.

## Pages

| Page | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Landing | `public/index.html` | Hero, why us vs generic AI, features, how-it-works, testimonials |
| Studio | `public/studio.html` | The analysis interface — paste essay, get full structured report |
| Mission | `public/mission.html` | Our principles, transparency, the full system prompt |

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENROUTER_API_KEY

# 3. Start the server
npm start
# → http://localhost:3000
```

## Security Architecture

- **API key is server-side only.** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` lives in `.env`, loaded by `dotenv`. It is never sent to the browser, never in any HTML/JS file, never in any response.
- All AI calls are proxied through `/api/analyze` (POST). The browser sends plain essay text; the server handles auth with OpenRouter.
- Input is size-limited (50kb body, 40,000 char essay max) to prevent abuse.
- Static files are served from `public/` — no framework, no build step, no client-side secrets.

## Analysis Output

Every audit generates a structured JSON report with:

- **Overall score** (1–100) + 4-dimensional breakdown (each /25)
- **Verdict** — one paragraph: persuasiveness, biggest strength, most urgent weakness
- **Coaching note** — single highest-leverage improvement action
- **Claim-by-claim analysis** — STRONG/MODERATE/WEAK ratings with named flaws and fixes
- **Assumption audit** — hidden premises with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW load-bearing ratings
- **Logical fallacies** — named, quoted verbatim, explained, rewritten
- **Steelmanned counter-arguments** — strongest opposition + damage assessment
- **Rhetorical analysis** — hook, flow, best/worst sentence with rewrite
- **Rewrite suggestions** — complete sentences, not instructions
